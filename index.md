In the meantime, why don't you check out my (horrendous) content on various sites:

- Check out how terribly I program at [GitHub](https://github.com/ezist){:rel="me"}.
- I'm on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/ezist){:rel="me"}. I don't have a witty remark for this.
- Why don't you take a look at my terrible music tastes on [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/ezist){:rel="me"}?
- I make post. Sometime good post I make. On [Pleroma](https://fedi.absturztau.be/ezist){:.pleroma}{:rel="me"}.
- See what horrible games I play on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ezist_/){:rel="me"} (or don't, cause my profile is private)
- I *don't* stream on [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/ezist2){:rel="me"}!
- Yes, I have a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ezist){:rel="me"}. Yes, I rarely use it.
