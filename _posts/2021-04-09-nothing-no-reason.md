What is the future, and why does it disappoint me so? Nothing; no reason  
Why does the future not recognize my dreams? No reason  
What are my dreams replaced by when they dissolve? Nothing  
What was the purpose of the dreams I no longer have? Nothing  
What is my reason? No reason  

I didn't want to lose my dreams so I created it  
Hiding and waiting, it seeks to destroy me  
When you sat beside me it became apparent to you  
It wanted me gone, it didn't want me here  

And so I faded, into what? Nothing  
And so I had a reason: no reason  
And so I sat next to you, on the last night of my world  
And so I faded
