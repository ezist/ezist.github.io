So I've made some improvements since the last post, like:

* Atom feed ~~Broken, will have to look into.~~ Fixed!
* GitHub banner
* ~~Added [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) :+1:~~ Update: replaced with [my own Jekyll plugin, using Twemoji!](https://github.com/ezist/ezist.github.io/blob/master/_plugins/twemoji.rb)
* Replaced the list of accounts with a fancy \~flexbox\~
* Added a 404 page

I'm really liking making this site. I hope I don't get feature creep, though.
