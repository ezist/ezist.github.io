And as I sit in the halls of darkness  
I see myself truely, once and for all

A mystery, a phantom  
The cause, the effect  
Something, nothing

Every essence of me had been shattered  
Every portion of memory was faded  
Every past me, no longer here to console me now

And as I sit in the halls of sadness  
I see myself truely, for the first and last time
