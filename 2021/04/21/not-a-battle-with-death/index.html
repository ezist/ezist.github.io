        </header><p class="indent-paragraph justify-text no-bottom-margin">The man considered it once again, looking at the ledge in front of him. As always, there was a <em>thing</em> holding him back. Never too specific, just a <em>thing</em>. <em>Things</em> always tortured him in these moments.</p>
<p class="indent-paragraph justify-text no-margin">He sighed and continued walking down the flight of stairs. Once reaching the bottom, he exited the apartment building and nearby saw a flock of homeless people. He looked away, that was just what people did.</p>
<p class="indent-paragraph justify-text no-margin">He wasn’t sure where he was walking to. In his head he thought, “Being nowhere’s better than being anywhere.” Sometimes he came up with these expressions. They were amusing in the moments after he thought of them.</p>
<p class="indent-paragraph justify-text no-margin">After a while, the man passed by a retirement home. He looked inside for a half-second and saw an old man needing an extreme amount of assistance moving around. He wondered why people fight such battles for so long.</p>
<p class="indent-paragraph justify-text no-margin">He believed that no matter how much money, hope, or luck you have, death was truly an inevitable force. Just then, he thought of another expression. This one seemed good to him.</p>
<p class="indent-paragraph"><em>“I fight not a battle with death, I fight a battle with life.”</em></p>
